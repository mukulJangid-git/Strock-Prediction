# Strock-Prediction (Self-Practice Project)
Project Overview
This project is a self-practice initiative focused on predicting the likelihood of a stroke based on various health-related factors. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can assist in identifying individuals at higher risk of stroke.

Technologies Used
The project primarily utilizes:

Jupyter Notebook (99.5% of the codebase) for data analysis, model development, and experimentation.

Python

Files and Folder Structure
The repository contains the following key components:

static/: Likely contains static assets like CSS, JavaScript, or images for a web interface.

templates/: Likely contains HTML templates for a web application.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Stroke_Prediction_Indians.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the stroke prediction model.

app.py: A Python script, likely the main application file for running the prediction model, possibly as a web service.

model.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

model.pkl: A serialized (pickled) machine learning model, ready for deployment and predictions.

How to Use (Local Setup)
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/mukulJangid-git/Strock-Prediction.git
cd Strock-Prediction
Install dependencies:
(You would typically list specific Python packages here, e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, flask. As these are not explicitly known from the browse output, you might need to infer them or add a note for the user to check requirements.)

Bash

# Example:
# pip install pandas scikit-learn flask
Run the application:

Bash

python app.py
(Further instructions for accessing the web interface, if app.py runs one, would go here.)

Model Training and Evaluation
The model.ipynb notebook details the process of:

Data loading and exploration.

Feature engineering and preprocessing.

Training of the stroke prediction model.

Evaluation of the model's performance.
